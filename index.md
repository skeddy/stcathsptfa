  ## St Catherine's Catholic Primary School PTFA

# 🎉 A warm (and fun) welcome to your PTFA 

Hey there! 

First off, welcome to the wonderful community of St Catherine's Catholic Primary School. 

We know your to-do list is already as long as a roll of wrapping paper, so we’ll keep this fun, friendly, and to the point. 

Let’s introduce you to the magic of the PTFA (that’s the Parent Teacher Friends Association, but we won’t make you say it three times fast).

## 🤔 Who are we? 

We’re the St Catherine's Catholic Primary School PTFA, and we’ve been making school life brighter, better, and a little more fun for over **[insert years here]**.

We’re a lively, creative bunch of volunteers with three big goals:
1. **Raise funds** to enrich and enhance your children’s learning experiences.
2. **Bring people together**—because when school and home team up, great things happen.
3. **Have a good time**—because life isn’t just about bake sales and raffles (though we do love a good raffle!).

## 😎 What’s in it for you? 

- A chance to meet new people and make friends.
- The warm, fuzzy feeling of making a real difference to your child’s school.
- Did we mention the fun?

## 🗓️ PTFA meetings 

We hold regular meetings throughout the year, and everyone’s welcome! Keep an eye on ParentMail or your email inbox for updates.

Our Annual General Meeting (AGM) kicks things off each school year. It’s a great opportunity to hear about our events, funds raised, and how your contributions are making a difference. Plus, we elect the new committee for the year—maybe you’ll be one of them?

## 💰 How we raise money 

We’re pros at turning everyday fun into funds. Think race nights, quiz nights, and plenty of cake (obviously). Plus, we run ongoing fundraisers and love trying out new ideas.

Your support—whether it’s time, donations, or a prize for the next raffle—is what makes it all happen. We truly couldn’t do it without you!

## Support from Parentkind 

We’re proud members of **Parentkind**, an organization that keeps us running smoothly with advice, insurance, and practical resources. They’ve even got helpful tips for parents—check them out on [their website](https://www.parentkind.org.uk) or Facebook page.
